    "\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "* If running on Windows, this requires WSL. Sextractor requires linux, and to run it we use WSL and run_sextractor.py creates a process (via WSL) and runs it\n",
    "* Make sure 'INPUT_PATH_FOLDER' is equivalent to 'WSL_INPUT_PATH_FOLDER' and 'OUTPUT_PATH_FOLDER' is equivalent to 'WSL_OUTPUT_PATH_FOLDER' or ELSE... it will break :'(\n",

    "Known Bugs:\n",
    "1) On windows \"#rerunm [WinError 3]The system cannot find the path specified\" exception - Try rerunning the whole script\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to Look out for:\n",
    "1) Make sure to keep: os.chdir(original_working_dir) in run_sextractor.py remains\n",
    "In order to run sextractor, we need to switch directories so if this line is removed, we may have issues in this script\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Becareful with galaxy names with spaces, sextractor breaks if name has space, so temporary (somewhat hacky, immidetidaly) work around is to rename file (hence run_on_fits_with_space_in_name function)\n",
    "I am aware that you can escape the spaces 'i.e. https://stackoverflow.com/a/65548647/13544635 or https://stackoverflow.com/a/25655627/13544635 ' however, the issue seems to be with sextractor format not linux so we rename the file. Because of renamming, if there is a folder called 'tmp' inside 'INPUT_PATH_FOLDER' it will break"
