    "Known Bugs:\n",
    "1) If source extractor objects has a center outside of bounds of fits image, function `create_elliptical_mask` in `mask.py` returns nothing\n",
    "For example: `NGC3312` has an object with dict = `{'XWIN_IMAGE': 765.473, 'YWIN_IMAGE': -7.86, ...}`\n",
    "Workaround: In function filter_objects in star_removal.py, added Step 5 to filter out centers outside of bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to Look out for:\n",
    "1) The biggest potential issue is photoutil and source extractor use different coordinate systems.\n",
